# Poker Bot – SneakPeek Hold’em Agent

This repository contains my submission for the **IIT Pokerbots Competition**, where autonomous agents compete in a variant of heads-up Texas Hold’em called **SneakPeek Hold’em**.

The bot combines **opponent modeling, probabilistic hand evaluation, and rule-based decision logic** to make decisions during play.

Detailed explanations of the bot architecture and strategy are provided in the `docs/` directory.
